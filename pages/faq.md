Are there storage facilities available at the venue for me to store personal belongings?
Unfortunately, there are no lockers or baggage storage facilities located at LLI. We recommend that you avoid bringing heavy luggage to the venue as you will need to exercise full responsibility and care over your personal belongings at all times. The organisers, partners, and its authorized agents are not liable or responsible for any loss, damage or injury arising from these items.
