<br>CSC was established as a statutory board under the Public Service Division in 2001. CSC aims to deliver innovative, inspiring, and impactful learning experiences for public officers.

LLI was launched in 2013 as one of the two Continuing Education and Training campuses (CET) by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). 

SCOGA was founded by a group of enthusiastic gamers and leaders who wanted to make a difference in the local gaming scene, especially in developing the local eSports scene. 

SCS is the leading infocomm and digital media professional society in Singapore, and the premier organisation for industry practitioners, leaders, students and ICT enthusiasts.
