> *The trends for the future is through exploring possibilities and co-creation. Developers created platforms for players to be 'co-creating' games, by bringing different perspectives and skills to the table. This is a platform for people across sectors, to create connections and conversations on games and simulations that bring real impact.*

The gamesXchange (GX) Conference, which was first held in 2014, is a platform for participants to learn and share on the meaningful use of games, simulations and gaming technology for impact, particularly for work and learning within the Public Sector. Run biennially, the Conference allows for interaction between the public-private-people sector to explore potential collaborations. 

2020 will mark the fourth run of GX, and the Civil Service College will once again be partnering with Lifelong Learning Institute and other industry partners such as the Singaporeâ€™s Cybersports & Online Gaming Association and Singapore Computer Society to make GX the conference to attend for games practitioners, designers and enthusiasts both within and without the Public Service. test
